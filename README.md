## Introduction

🔥🌿🐦🔥 PhyloPHoeNIx is meant to be run in tandem with [🔥🐦🔥 PHoeNIx](https://github.com/CDCgov/phoenix/wiki/) to aid in outbreak investigations by estimating relatedness between samples. Both pipelines were built and are maintained by bioinformatians in the **CDC's [Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP)](https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/divisions-offices/about-dhqp.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dhqp/index.html)** to standardize surveillance of [antibiotic resistance threats](https://www.cdc.gov/antimicrobial-resistance/media/pdfs/antimicrobial-resistance-threats-update-2022-508.pdf), identification of novel resistance threats and support public health laboratories in their genomic analysis of healthcare-associated infection organisms. PhyloPHoeNIx is a comprehensive pipeline that performs:  

- Automation of DHQP's iterative outbreak analysis (runs analysis on all samples and when --by_st is passed also separates isolates by ST and runs each group through the analysis)  
- SNV (single-nucleotide variant) matrix creation  
- Phylogenetic tree building  
- Reports the % core genome used in the SNV determination  

**cdcgov/phylophoenix** is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline for relatedness determination using PHoeNIx output.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. 

## Quick Start

1. Install [`Nextflow`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation) (`>=22.10.1`)

2. Install any of [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) or [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/) (you can follow [this tutorial](https://singularity-tutorial.github.io/01-installation/)) for full pipeline reproducibility.

3. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command:

   ```bash
   nextflow run cdcgov/phylophoenix -profile test,singularity --outdir <OUTDIR>
   ```
   Note that some form of configuration will be needed so that Nextflow knows how to fetch the required software. This is usually done in the form of a config profile (`YOURPROFILE` in the example command above). You can chain multiple config profiles in a comma-separated string.

   > - The pipeline comes with config profiles called `docker` and `singularity` which instruct the pipeline to use the named tool for software management. For example, `-profile test,docker`.
   > - Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.
   > - If you are using `singularity`, please use the [`nf-core download`](https://nf-co.re/tools/#downloading-pipelines-for-offline-use) command to download images first, before running the pipeline. Setting the [`NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` or `singularity.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/singularity.html?#singularity-docker-hub) Nextflow options enable you to store and re-use the images from a central location for future pipeline runs.

4. Start running your own analysis!

## Running PhyloPHoeNIx

### Inputs

You can either input samples using a typical nextflow samples sheet. This samplesheet should have the columns `sample,directory`. Here the directory would be to a sample's directory within a larger PHoeNIx output directory. For example, your samplesheet should look like this:

```
sample,directory
2023BB-00546,/PATH/PHX_output_dir/2023BB-00546
2023BB-00847,/PATH/PHX_output_dir/2023BB-00847
```

This method is useful for combining samples from different PHoeNIx directories and the full command would look like this:

   ```bash
   nextflow run cdcgov/phylophoenix -profile singularity --outdir <OUTDIR> --input Directory_samplesheet.csv
   ```

Alternatively, if you want to analyze all samples in one PHoeNIx output directory you can pass the path to `--input_dir` and a samplesheet as described above will be created from all samples in this directory. Using this method the full command would look like this:  

   ```bash
   nextflow run cdcgov/phylophoenix -profile singularity --outdir <OUTDIR> --indir <PATH TO PHOENIX DIR>
   ```

By default PhyloPHoeNIx creates a SNV matrix and phylogenetic tree from all samples that pass QC in the directory. If you want to also group samples by MLST and create additional SNV matrices and phylogenetic trees for each MLST pass the `--by_st` argument.  

   ```bash
   nextflow run cdcgov/phylophoenix -profile singularity --outdir <OUTDIR> --input Directory_samplesheet.csv --by_st
   ```

If you want to skip running all samples together and just want to run in `--by_st` mode add the `--no_all` parameter.  

   ```bash
   nextflow run cdcgov/phylophoenix -profile singularity --outdir <OUTDIR> --input Directory_samplesheet.csv --by_st --no_all
   ```

**A minimum of 3 samples of the same MLST are required to create a SNV matrix and phylogenetic tree.**

### Outputs

Here is an example output file tree that is reduced for space (3 samples are the min for creating a phylogenetic tree).
