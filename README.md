## Introduction

üî•üåøüê¶üî• PhyloPHoeNIx is meant to be run in tandem with üî•üê¶üî• PHoeNIx to aid in outbreak investigations by estimate relatedness between samples. The core of PhyloPHoeNIx is a pipleline originally developed by @apetkau (Aaron Petkau), called SNVPhyl. There is a standalone [Nextflow version of SNVPhyl](https://github.com/DHQP/SNVPhyl_Nextflow) should you need it. For documentation on the pipeline and how it works see the following links.

**dhqp/phylophoenix** is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline for relatedness determination using PHoeNIx output.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community!

<!-- TODO nf-core: Add full-sized test dataset and amend the paragraph below if applicable -->

On release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources.The results obtained from the full-sized test can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/phylophoenix/results).

## Quick Start

1. Install [`Nextflow`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation) (`>=22.10.1`)

2. Install any of [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) or [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/) (you can follow [this tutorial](https://singularity-tutorial.github.io/01-installation/)) for full pipeline reproducibility.

3. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command:

   ```bash
   nextflow run dhqp/phylophoenix -profile test,cdcsge,singularity --outdir <OUTDIR>
   ```
   Note that some form of configuration will be needed so that Nextflow knows how to fetch the required software. This is usually done in the form of a config profile (`YOURPROFILE` in the example command above). You can chain multiple config profiles in a comma-separated string.

   > - The pipeline comes with config profiles called `docker` and `singularity` which instruct the pipeline to use the named tool for software management. For example, `-profile test,docker`.
   > - Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.
   > - If you are using `singularity`, please use the [`nf-core download`](https://nf-co.re/tools/#downloading-pipelines-for-offline-use) command to download images first, before running the pipeline. Setting the [`NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` or `singularity.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/singularity.html?#singularity-docker-hub) Nextflow options enables you to store and re-use the images from a central location for future pipeline runs.

4. Start running your own analysis!

## Running PhyloPHoeNIx

### Inputs

You can either input samples using a typical nextflow samples sheet. This samplesheet should have the columns `sample,directory`. Here the directory would be to a sample's directory within a larger PHoeNIx output directory. For example, your samplesheet should look like this:

```
sample,directory
2023BB-00546,/PATH/PHX_output_dir/2023BB-00546
2023BB-00847,/PATH/PHX_output_dir/2023BB-00847
```

This method is useful for combing samples from different PHoeNIx directories and the full command woud look like this:

   ```bash
   nextflow run dhqp/phylophoenix -profile cdcsge,singularity --outdir <OUTDIR> --input Directory_samplesheet.csv
   ```

Alternatively, if you want analyze all samples in one PHoeNIx output directory you can pass the path to `--input_dir` and a samplesheet as described above will be created from all samples in this to directory. Using this method the full command would look like this:

   ```bash
   nextflow run dhqp/phylophoenix -profile cdcsge,singularity --outdir <OUTDIR> --input_dir <PATH TO PHOENIX DIR>
   ```

By default PhyloPHoeNIx creates a SNV matrix and phylogenetic tree from all samples that pass QC in the directory. If you want to also group samples by ST and create additional SNV matrices and phylogenetic trees for each ST type pass the `--by_ST` argument. 

   ```bash
   nextflow run dhqp/phylophoenix -profile cdcsge,singularity --outdir <OUTDIR> --input Directory_samplesheet.csv --by_ST
   ```
A minimum of 3 samples of the sample ST are required to create a SNV matrix and phylogenetic tree.
